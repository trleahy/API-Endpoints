      <itunes:summary>From the moment Donald Trump and Kamala Harris walked off the debate stage, both their campaigns have argued about who won the showdown.

But the real question is what the debate meant to a small sliver of voters in a handful of swing states.

Campbell Robertson, a reporter on The Times’s National desk, and Stella Tan, a producer on “The Daily,” speak to three undecided voters about what they saw during the debate, and how much closer it brought them to a decision.

Guest:
